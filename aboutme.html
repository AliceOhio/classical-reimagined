                Born in 1974 in a family with a history of musical excellence it surprised no one that I began playing
                piano at the age of three, continuing through to my early twenties while receiving a bachelor’s degree
                in music, studying under the esteemed Elizabeth Pastor.

                It was there I realized the importance of not
                just classical music itself but in the actual performance, the musician behind the performance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here, in this collection, I will curate a personalized unique musical journey cultivated to your
                specific needs. What is stopping you from being the best you in this moment? The proper choice of music
